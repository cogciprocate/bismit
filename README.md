BISMIT

Biologically Inspired Sensory Motor Inference Tool

A model of the neocortex for interpreting and classifying (input) data for the purpose of taking action (output).

A descendant of Bayesian and hidden Markov neural networks and incorporating concepts from the theory of hierarchical temporal memory, Bismit goes far beyond the traditional concept of a neural network.
