BISMIT

Biologically Inspired Sensory Motor Inference Tool

A model of the neocortex for interpreting and classifying data, then acting based on it.

A descendant of Bayesian and hidden Markov neural networks, Bismit compartmentalizes the task of inference into sub-sections, referred to as columns.
