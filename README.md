BISMIT

Biologically Inspired Sensory Motor Inference Tool

A model of the neocortex for interpreting data (input) and taking action (output).

One of the first members of the next paradigm, beyond Bayesian and hidden Markov neural networks, incorporating ideas from the theory of hierarchical temporal memory, such as sparse distributed representations and temporal context, Bismit is a machine designed to model our latest functional understanding of the neocortex. We are now within close reach (8 - 10 years, a factor of ~1000) of matching the processing power of the human neocortex on a $1000 device. By leveraging the parallel computing power offered by GPGPUs, Bismit will lead the way towards that goal.

Bismit is written in Rust and OpenCL C and is in an unstable pre-alpha stage.
