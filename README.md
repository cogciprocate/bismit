BISMIT

Biologically Inspired Sensory Motor Inference Tool: 
A model of the neocortex for interpreting data and taking action based on prediction.

One of the first of the next paradigm of learning networks, beyond Bayesian and hidden Markov models, incorporating ideas from the theory of hierarchical temporal memory, such as sparse distributed representations and temporal context, Bismit is a model which incorporates our most recent and up-to-date findings about the neocortex. It is not a typical "Machine Learning" platform and does not use traditional computational statistics methods. It's emphasis is, however, similarly on both classification and prediction. The biggest fundamental difference between the two methods is the manner in which prediction is integrated into the network.

We are now within close reach, eight to ten years or a factor of about a thousand, of matching the processing power of the human neocortex on a $1000 device. By harnessing the inexpensive parallel computing power offered by GPGPUs (or any other OpenCL device) we can build a platform to best utilize that amount of power, intended for maximum performance with maximum flexibility in computing device interoperability.

Bismit is written in Rust and OpenCL C and is in an unstable pre-alpha stage. Full basic functionality is expected by the end of Summer, 2015.
