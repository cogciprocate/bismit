#BISMIT

Biologically Inspired Sensory Motor Inference Tool: 
A model of the neocortex for interpreting data and taking action based on prediction.

Bismit is one of the first of the next paradigm of learning networks. Going beyond Bayesian and hidden Markov models, incorporating ideas from the theory of hierarchical temporal memory, such as sparse distributed representations and temporal context, Bismit is a model which incorporates our most recent and up-to-date findings about the neocortex. It is not a typical "Machine Learning" platform and does not use traditional statistical methods. 

Bismit is written in Rust and OpenCL C and is in an unstable pre-alpha stage. Full basic functionality is expected by the end of Summer, 2015.



[//]: # POSTSCRIPT (move this elsewhere): 

[//]: # We are now within close reach, eight to ten years or a factor of about a thousand, of matching the processing power of the human neocortex on a $1000 device. By harnessing the inexpensive parallel computing power offered by GPGPUs (or any other OpenCL device) we can build a platform to best utilize that amount of power, intended for maximum performance with maximum flexibility in computing device interoperability.
