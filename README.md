BISMIT

Biologically Inspired Sensory Motor Inference Tool

A model of the neocortex for interpreting and classifying (input) data for the purpose of taking action (output).

Borrowing concepts from Bayesian and hidden Markov neural networks and incorporating ideas from the theory of hierarchical temporal memory, Bismit goes far beyond the traditional concept of a neural network and indeed any known model of the neocortex. By leveraging the parallel computing power offered by modern GPGPUs using OpenCL, Bismit will hasten the arrival of the truly general purpose learning machine.

Bismit is written in Rust and OpenCL C.
